//Promises and Time part-1

/* Q12 
Given two promises promise1 and promise2, return a new promise. promise1 and promise2 will both resolve with a number. The returned promise should resolve with the sum of the two numbers.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 20)), 
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(5), 60))
Output: 7
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 2 and 5 respectively. The returned promise should resolve with a value of 2 + 5 = 7. The time the returned promise resolves is not judged for this problem.
 */

var addTwoPromises = async function (promise1, promise2) {
    const res1 = await promise1;
    const res2 = await promise2;
    // return res1 + res2;

    const ans = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve(res1 + res2);
    })

    return ans;
};

/* Q13
Given a positive integer millis, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for millis milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

Note that minor deviation from millis in the actual sleep duration is acceptable.

Example 1:

Input: millis = 100
Output: 100
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.
let t = Date.now();
sleep(100).then(() => {
  console.log(Date.now() - t); // 100
});
*/

async function sleep(millis) {
    // return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    //     setTimeout(() => {
    //         resolve();
    //     }, millis);
    // })

    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, millis));
}

/* Q14
Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and a timeout t in milliseconds, return a cancel function cancelFn.

After a delay of cancelTimeMs, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be invoked.

setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)
Initially, the execution of the function fn should be delayed by t milliseconds.

If, before the delay of t milliseconds, the function cancelFn is invoked, it should cancel the delayed execution of fn. Otherwise, if cancelFn is not invoked within the specified delay t, fn should be executed with the provided args as arguments.

Example 1:

Input: fn = (x) => x * 5, args = [2], t = 20
Output: [{"time": 20, "returned": 10}]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 50;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x) => x * 5, [2], 20);
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelTimeMs (50ms), which happened after the execution of fn(2) at 20ms.

var cancellable = function (fn, args, t) {
    const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
        fn(...args);
    }, t);
    return function cancelFn() {
        clearTimeout(timerId);
    }

};

/* Q15
Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and an interval time t, return a cancel function cancelFn.

After a delay of cancelTimeMs, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be invoked.

setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)
The function fn should be called with args immediately and then called again every t milliseconds until cancelFn is called at cancelTimeMs ms.

Example 1:

Input: fn = (x) => x * 2, args = [4], t = 35
Output: 
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 35, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 70, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 105, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 140, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 175, "returned": 8}
]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 190;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x) => x * 2, [4], 35);
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

Every 35ms, fn(4) is called. Until t=190ms, then it is cancelled.
1st fn call is at 0ms. fn(4) returns 8.
2nd fn call is at 35ms. fn(4) returns 8.
3rd fn call is at 70ms. fn(4) returns 8.
4th fn call is at 105ms. fn(4) returns 8.
5th fn call is at 140ms. fn(4) returns 8.
6th fn call is at 175ms. fn(4) returns 8.
Cancelled at 190ms
